<h2> Blank easy to use Wordpress theme based on Webpack</h2>

If you want to build your Wordpress theme from scratch using modern day front-end standarts this is a right tool.
Theme is designed to be as minimal as possible with freedom to modify it to the way you need. Use it as a starter
for building custom UI.

<h2> What's included? </h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Webpack</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Babel</strong></li>
  <li><strong>SASS</strong></li>
  <li><strong>PostCSS</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Stylelint</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Eslint</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2> Getting started </h2>
Clone this repository into your wordpress project themes directory.
npm install
npm run start

It will build css and js bundles inside theme's /src/dist directory based on sources inside /src/js/main.js.
Compiled bundles are already registered in theme's functions.php file so no additional configuration is needed!
You can modify templates for your own projects in a way you need and start focusing on building your theme imediately.
